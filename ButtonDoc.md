### General guidance

**Buttons are used to initialize an action.** Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

**Buttons are used primarily for actions.** Examples include Add, Save, Delete, and Sign up. Each page should have one primary button, and a Return or Enter keyboard event should trigger it. Any remaining calls-to-action should be represented as secondary buttons.

**Do not use buttons as navigational elements.** Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

**Primary buttons always appear to the right.** Secondary buttons appear to the left of the primary button.
