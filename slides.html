            Hello everyone, and welcome to "component documentation made easy".
            My name is Bart Ledoux and I'm a Design Tech Lead in Chicago.

            A bit about me: 
            - I help organize the Chicago VueJs meetup, we are laways looking for new talks.
            - I am pretty active on Vue Land, the VueJs official Discord server.
            - I help maintain the VueJs side of Storybook, one of the reasons I am here today
            - I actively maintain a library called Vue-Styleguidist. If you do not know about it yet, just wait 
            a few minutes, I am getting to that. Overall, it's a design system documetation tool.

            By show of hands, how many of you here are designing or specifying Design Systems?
            [click]
            By show of hands again, how many of you here are developping, actually writing the code for a Design System?
            [click]
            And how many of you are writing code that uses components of an existing Design System or a component library like vuetify?

            Well this talk is for you and for all of us who want to better communicate.
            To help me tell you a little bit about how to go about it, here are three characters that are building an amazing product.

            Dominic, Sarah and Patrick are going to work together ad build a story from idea to product.

            So, you might be asking, why is documentation so important that someone would write a talk about it.
            Well, basically, it all sums down to this: no one wants to be handed off a "blurrg".
            [click]
            Here, in the first episode of the Mandalorian, Mando gets one vehicle to go through the Badlands: A beast named a blurrg.
            This wild mount throws him almost instantly off his back. Touching scene that show Mando as vulnerable, 
            great show if you have not seen it yet... 
            Back to components: nobody wants to have to tame the components before use.
            What interrests me more in this scene is what Mando says just afterwards:
            [click]
            Uh! I don't have time for this! Don't you have a land speeder or a speeder bike I can hire?
            We all are in the same situation when consuming components. We want the speeder bike, not the blurrg...
            Well, I know they are cute but time is money.
            [click]
            The worst in this case is that it often takes more time to write the documentation than to tame the components.
            Sarah does not have tie fo this either

            Sarah still wants to do her job right. She still needs to document the components. 
            What do we do when we have a repetitive task?
